Slipstream Mod Manager

About

  Slipstream is a mod manager for the game FasterThanLight, making it
  easy to install multiple mods at the same time and, later, revert
  to vanilla gameplay.

  It is the successor to Grognak's Mod Manager (GMM).


Requirements

  Java (1.6 or higher).
    http://www.java.com/en/download/

  FTL (1.01-1.5.13, Windows/OSX/Linux, Steam/GOG/Standalone).
    https://subsetgames.com/


Setup

  Extract the files from this archive anywhere.

  On the first run, you may be prompted to locate your FTL resources.
  Specifically "data.dat" in a directory where FTL was installed.

  On OSX, you can select "FTL.app", because the resources are inside it.

  In most cases, this should be located automatically.


Usage

  To add a mod (an *.ftl file):
    Put it in the Slipstream/mods/ folder.

  To start the mod manager:
    Double-click modman.command.

  To install mods:
    Tick checkboxes to select the mods you want to install.
    Mods at the top get clobbered by ones below. Drag names to reorder.
    Click the "Patch" button.
    (Any unselected mods will be omitted/uninstalled.)

  To uninstall all mods:
    Click "Patch" with none selected.

  Before upgrading Slipstream:
    Uninstall all mods, so the next version will see a clean game.

  If you upgrade FTL:
    Delete the outdated files in Slipstream/backup/
	This can be done from the menu: Help-"Delete Backups".
    If you don't, the game's resources will get corrupted.

  Commandline:
    Run "./modman-cli.sh -h" for commandline usage.


Troubleshooting

* If double-clicking modman.command doesn't work on Linux...
    Several terminals have bugs executing scripts whose paths contain spaces.
    There's no universal way to create a relative *.desktop shortcut either.
    For now, you'll need to open a terminal yourself.
      Then drag modman-cli.sh onto that window (saves typing), and hit enter.

* If you get "java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError" on startup...
    You need a newer version of Java.

* If you get permission errors...
    Make sure resource.dat and data.dat aren't read-only.

* If the game shows exclamation marks for everything...
    See the suggestion below for replacing corrupt resources.

* If text in-game is shrunken and moved to the top of the screen...
    FTL was upgraded, but Slipstream modded with backups from the old FTL.
    See the suggestion below for replacing corrupt resources.

* If FTL's resources are corrupt...
    Option 1:
      In SMM, Help-"Delete Backups"
      Steam users:
        In SMM, Help-"Steam: Verify integrity of game files".
      Standalone users:
        Reinstall FTL.

    Option 2:
      Delete the files in SMM/backup/
      Steam users:
        Start Steam and "verify integrity of game files".
          https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335
      Standalone users:
        Reinstall FTL.

* UnmappableCharacterException during patching...
    For FTL 1.01-1.5.13, Slipstream re-encodes text to windows-1252, which
    restricts the set of characters that can be used in mods. Click the
    Validate button to find any problematic characters. FTL 1.6.1 switched to
    unicode and should not have this problem.
