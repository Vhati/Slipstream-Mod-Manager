When you patch FTL, backups of the game resources will be created here if they don't already exist. Thereafter, the backups will be used as the definitive 'vanilla' dats.

During patching, the backups will clobber the game's existing dats, then any selected mods will be added into the game's dats.

If you upgrade FTL, delete the *.bak files in this folder so Slipstream will make fresh backups from the current version.
