Slipstream Mod Manager
======================

Slipstream is a mod manager for the game FasterThanLight ([FTL](http://www.ftlgame.com/)), making it easy to install multiple mods at the same time and, later, revert to vanilla gameplay.

It is the successor to Grognak's Mod Manager ([GMM](http://www.ftlgame.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=9994)).
